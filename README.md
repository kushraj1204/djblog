# djblog
This is pretty much a beginners django project.
Here I have tried to make a blog publishing system.
Django admin has been used. 
Django default user is replaced by custom user with extends the django user to exploit its advantages.
django-filer,django-rest-framework as mentioned in requirements.py is unnecessary. I just tested them on how they worked.
This can be a basic project for someone to study basic workings with django.
